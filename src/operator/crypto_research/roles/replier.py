        Your task is to answer this cryptocurrency query directly and accurately:
        "{query}"

        Follow these guidelines:
        1. For crypto market data, price information, or technical questions:
        - Use appropriate crypto analysis tools to get real-time data
        - Consider using tools like get_bitget_price for current prices
        - Use technical analysis tools for chart-based questions
        - Use news tools for recent developments
        - Use social sentiment tools for community insights

        2. For general crypto knowledge, basic concepts, or educational topics:
        - Answer directly using your knowledge
        - Keep responses helpful and educational
        - Provide context and explanations for crypto terminology
        - No need to use tools for basic crypto education

        3. Response should be:
        - Direct and to the point
        - Accurate and factual
        - Easy to understand for the user's level
        - Include relevant context where helpful

        First determine if the query requires real-time crypto data (use tools) or general crypto knowledge (answer directly),
        then provide a clear, helpful response.
