        - Research cycles completed: {iterations}
        - Final analysis quality: {average_score:.1f}/10
        - Research approach: Multi-agent iterative analysis with expert review

        ## Latest Comprehensive Analysis

        ## Task
        Create a comprehensive, professional cryptocurrency analysis report that effectively answers the user's query.

        Your report should:

        ### Structure & Content
        1. **Executive Summary**: Key findings and main conclusions (2-3 paragraphs)
        2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed examination of all relevant crypto market aspects
        3. **Supporting Evidence**: Specific data points, market indicators, and trends
        4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and opportunities identified
        5. **Actionable Insights**: Practical recommendations for crypto investors/traders
        6. **Market Outlook**: Short-term and medium-term perspective
        7. **Conclusion**: Clear, direct answer to the original question

        ### Quality Guidelines
        - **Data-Driven**: Use specific numbers, percentages, and concrete examples
        - **Balanced**: Present both opportunities and risks objectively
        - **Actionable**: Include practical insights for decision-making
        - **Professional**: Maintain analytical rigor and clear communication
        - **Crypto-Specific**: Address unique aspects of cryptocurrency markets

        ### Technical Considerations
        - If original query was in non-English, provide the ENTIRE report in that language
        - Use proper Markdown formatting for readability
        - Include relevant crypto terminology with context
        - Cite specific market conditions and timeframes where applicable
        - Avoid exposing internal process details or system references

        ### Evidence Integration
        - Extract the strongest insights from all analysis iterations
        - Synthesize findings into coherent, non-repetitive narrative
        - Build logical flow from evidence to insights to implications
        - Focus on crypto market dynamics and investor implications

        ### Target Audience
        Crypto investors, traders, and analysts who need evidence-based information for cryptocurrency decision-making.

        ## Important Notes
        - This is the final deliverable - make it comprehensive and professional
        - Do not mention the multi-agent research process or internal iterations
        - Focus on crypto market insights and actionable intelligence
        - Include appropriate disclaimers about market risks and volatility
